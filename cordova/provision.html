        To provision the trusted assets store to the browser, it needs to be loaded by the browser and stored in the browser's local storage:
        <ul>
        <li>Provide a name for the trusted assets store to be saved into the local storage. This will also be the name the application provides as the trusted assets store.</li>
        <li>Select the trusted assets store file.  <b>The file will be automatically loaded and stored.</b></li>
        <li>The contents of the trusted assets store will be displayed in the browser for verification if required.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <label for="tasName">Name of trusted assets store to store:</label>
        <input id="tasNname" minLength="1" name="tasNname" required size="30" type="text"/>
