Connected Worker Stationary Gateway and Node for BLE devices

This package contains build of both Connected Worker gateway and Node for 
Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS. Gateway requires Raspberry Pi v3 with BLE and WiFi.
Node implementation runs on Raspberry Pi Zero with BLE and Wifi.

After unpacking cw-gateway.tar.gz on the device, change directory into cw-gateway/cw-gw-backend and run
(before executing cw_setup make sure you have properly set up proxy - see Proxy settings below)

sudo -E ./cw_setup.sh

Shell script will guide you through installation steps. On the gateway device answer Y to 'Setup Gateway?' prompt.
On the node device answer N to this prompt and answer Y to 'Setup Node?'.

Gateway must be provisioned in order to communicate with IoT / CW backend. Save your provisioning file as 
cw-gateway/cw-gw-backend/cw-gw-1.csv. In case of different name you will need to update iotcs.provisioningFile 
in cw-gateway/cw-gw-backend/config/settings.json. Optionaly change provisioningPassword and other parameters if
needed.

To run CW Gateway go to cw-gateway/cw-gw-backend and run

./run-server.sh

To run CW Node go to cw-gateway/cw-gw-backend and run

./run-client.sh

Web console runs on the gateway port specified during gateway setup (e.g. 9000)

http://GATEWAY_HOST:GATEWAY_PORT/console


Proxy settings:
If you are behind a proxy server, you will need to 

export http_proxy=http://YOUR_PROXY:YOUR_PROXY_PORT/
export https_proxy=http://YOUR_PROXY:YOUR_PROXY_PORT/

and make sure you have properly configured apt proxy in /etc/apt.conf

sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf

Acquire::http::Proxy "http://YOUR_PROXY:YOUR_PROXY_PORT";
